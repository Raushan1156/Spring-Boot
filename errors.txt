1) com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException: Cannot construct instance of com.RestApi.crudapi.dto.EmployeeDto (no Creators, like default constructor, exist): cannot deserialize from Object value (no delegate- or property-based Creator)

Ans: I was missing below line in prop file.
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

2)Sequence "EMPLOYEE_SEQ" not found; SQL statement:
select next value for employee_seq [90036-232]

Ans: I was missing the default constructer in my dto class.


3) org.hibernate.StaleObjectStateException: Row was updated or deleted by another transaction (or unsaved-value mapping was incorrect): [com.RestApi.crudapi.entity.EmployeeEntity#2]

This occured when I tried to update the row which doesn't exist.
